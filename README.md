# Covid_19_india
COVID-19 Analysis and Reporting Project: A basic data-driven project that aims to analyze and report on the COVID-19 pandemic. This project uses real-time data to explore various aspects such as confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and trends across different regions.  It utilizes Jupyter Notebook with Python 3 (IPython kernel) for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization.

# Project Overview
The main objectives of this project are:
1. Perform data cleaning and preparation to ensure the accuracy and quality of the data.
2. Conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the COVID-19 dataset.
3. Produce different datasets as CSV files for further analysis and reporting.
4. Extract and analyze confirmed cases by state for each day.
5. Create a report of total deaths state-wise in descending order.
6. Generate a consolidated report for all states, grouped by month.
7. Provide basic visuals to aid in understanding the data.

# Setup and Dependencies
To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

a. Jupyter Notebook (with Python 3 kernel)
b. Pandas
c. Matplotlib (for basic visualizations)

# Instructions
Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
Install the necessary dependencies mentioned above.
Open the Jupyter Notebook files (Covid_19_india.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook.
Execute the cells in the notebooks step by step to perform data cleaning, EDA, and generate the desired datasets.
You can find the produced datasets in the datasets/ directory for further analysis and reporting.
Explore the visualizations in the visualizations/ directory to gain a better understanding of the data.

Feel free to customize, modify, or extend the project to suit your specific requirements and goals.

Let's dive into the world of COVID-19 data analysis and gain valuable insights together! Stay safe and healthy!
